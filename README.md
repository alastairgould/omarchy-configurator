# Omarchy Installer

This is a minimal frontend for archinstall, which collects the user information and disk choice that is then used by [the omarchy-iso setup](https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-iso) to produce the full archinstall JSON needed for setting up a full system.

This repository is pulled into the omarchy-iso-make process at runtime.
